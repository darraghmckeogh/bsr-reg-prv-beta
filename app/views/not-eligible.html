      <p>
        To be registered, buildings must have 7 floors or more or be 18 metres or more in height.
      </p>

      <p>
        They must also have 2 or more residential units that people are living in, or will be living in. 
      </p>

      <p>
        They must also have already been completed. If your block has not yet been completed then you should register again once it has been completed.

      <p>
        If you have questions about why your building cannot be registered based on the information you have given us, <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
