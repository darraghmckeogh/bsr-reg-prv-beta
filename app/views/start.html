      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>You need to tell us if the building has multiple independent sections.</p>

          <p>Any collection of units that are accessed from the same main entrance, or can only be accessed through a party wall, walkway, shared lobby or basement, are an independent section.</p>
          <p>These independent sections may have different names. For example, 'Hawthorn Shopping Centre' and 'Primrose Apartments'.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <p>You must tell us the following information about the building:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the number of floors at or above ground level</li>
        <li>its height in metres</li>
        <li>the number of residential units</li>
        <li>the year it was originally built</li>
        <li>its address or addresses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your building has multiple independent sections, you must tell us this information for each independent section.</p>

      <p>You will also be asked about the principal accountable person and any other accountable persons we need to know about.</p>

      <p>To complete your application, you must declare that all the information you have told us is correct.</p>

      <p>Then you must pay for the application.</p>

      <p>After you have paid, we will then ask you for more detailed structure and safety information about the building.</p>

      <p>Once you have started you'll have until 28 October 2023 to complete your application, and give us all the information we need to know about the building.</p>

      <p>You can save your application and return to it at any time.</p>

      <p>You can use this service as many times as you need. But you can only give us information about 1 building at a time.</p>

      <p>This service costs £--- per building. You can pay by credit or debit card.</p>
