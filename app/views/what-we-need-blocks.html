        Tell us about each of the independent sections in this building

      <p>An independent section is a collection of units in the building that share a main entrance, or can only be accessed crossing a party wall, walkway, shared lobby or basement.</p>
      
      <p>An independent section may have a different height, roof and address to other sections of the building.</p>

      <p>Do not count the connecting walkway, shared lobby or basement as a section, unless it contains a residential unit.</p>

      <p>We will ask you for information one section at a time. You can tell us about the other sections later.</p>
