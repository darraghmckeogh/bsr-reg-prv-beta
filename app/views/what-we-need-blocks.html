        Tell us about each of the independent sections in {{ data['building-name'] }}

      <p>An independent section is a collection of units in the building that share a main entrance, or can only be accessed by crossing a party wall, walkway, shared lobby or basement. </p>

      <p>These independent sections may have different names. For example, 'Hawthorn Shopping Centre' and 'Primrose Apartments'.</p>

      <p>We will ask you for information one section at a time. You can tell us about the other sections later.</p>

      <p>For each section, you must tell us:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the number of floors at or above ground level</li>
        <li>the height from ground level to the top floor</li>
        <li>the number of residential units</li>
        <li>if people are living in it</li>
        <li>the year it was originally built and ready for people to live in it</li>
        <li>its address</li>
        <li>if it has any other addresses</li>
      </ul>
